The mission to Mars assignment was challenging, but provided a good learning expereince combining python. flask, html and css. 
We started with a Jupyter Notebook file and created all of the scraping code there. We scraped four different websites about Mars news and facts. We scraped news, images, data in a comparision table and more images.
All Jupyter notebook code was added to the Scrape_Mars.py file and that file was run in python. Next an app.py file was run on the flask server to call the defined function in mars_scrape.

The last part involved rendering everything in html and css to create the index.html file. Bootstrap code was used for formatting. 
A button on the html page called the scrape function and updates data in real time. 
Data was also stored in Mongo DB.
